# InfraRed Power Line

This project is an Arduino compatible software that control a power line using InfraRed remote control.

You can see it working on Youtube:

I made it with Arduino Uno and Aduino IDE 1.8.0.  

I have replaced the default arduino InfraRed(because it doesn't compile) with this:

If it compile on your machine you didn't replace, no changes need be done on code with both libraries.
